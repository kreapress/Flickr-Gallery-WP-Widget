Flickr Gallery WP Widget
=====================

This is very basic WP widget which I use in my themes to display the latest photos from the widget. It is both very simple to use (which means you can easily add new features) and lightweight.

It doesn't come with any CSS styling, just 2 JavaScript files are loaded and there are just 2 options:

*	which ID to fetch the images from and
*	how many of the images to display (1 to 10)

Installation
------------

Clone this repository (or download zipball and unzip it) to your plugins directory (usually `wp-content/plugins`) and activate it over the wp-admin.

Customizations
--------------

In the file `js/custom.js` you will find the jQuery plugin `jflickrfeed` called. You can customize the output markup and customize the plugin by your needs, the detailed instructions and the demo can be found [on this original post by Joel Sutherland](http://www.gethifi.com/blog/a-jquery-flickr-feed-plugin).
